                <p>
                    I work in the <a href="http://cs.ubc.ca/labs/nss">Networks, Systems and Security
                    Laboratory</a> at <a href="http://ubc.ca">UBC</a> under the supervision
                    of <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~andy/">Andy Warfield</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/bill-aiello">Bill
                        Aiello</a>. My focus is on web-scale computing, particularly around
                    advancing the HTML5 browser as a platform for rich, distributed applications.
                    I'm also interested in security and privacy in social networks, and on the web
                    in general. NSS has a proud history of building real systems and submitting
                    work to top-tier Computer Science conferences.

                <h3>Teaching</h3>
                <p>
                    I've taught <a href="http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs317">Computer Science 317</a> 
                    (Internet Computing)
                    with Bill Aiello twice in past years, and a third time
                    with Donald Acton this year (Jan - Apr, 2013.)
                    The course covers the hardware and software layers of
                    computer networks, as well as the protocols used to move
                    data through them. I've developed
                    network programming assignments in C and Java, as well as taught weekly
                    labs/tutorials. Among other things, assignments have included building a web server,
                    simulating a switch with VLAN support, and implementing IP forwarding and
                    routing algorithms.
